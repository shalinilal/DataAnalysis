# Electronic Devices Data Analysis Software 

This software analyzes data from semiconductor electronic devices like transistors and diodes. This software outputs trends, data plots, statistical deductions for different types of device measurements and experiment conditions. This software has been used extensively to analyze 20 million data points spanning across 100s of advanced semiconductor devices like
* Lateral transistors like HEMT, FETS
* Vertical transistors like CAVET, BAVET
* Diodes
* TLM Structures


### Prerequisites
* Operating System: Microsoft Windows 7 version 6.1 64 bit or later versions (You can also use a Microsoft VM), 4GB RAM, 4 CPU
* Tools: Matlab R2018a or later versions (should cantain Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox)
